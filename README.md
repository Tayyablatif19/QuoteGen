# ðŸ“œ Random Quotes App

A simple React application that fetches random quotes from an API and displays them in a clean UI.  
This project was built as part of my learning journey to strengthen my React skills.

### 1. **React Fundamentals**
- How to create and organize components in React.
- Understanding how `App.js` serves as the main entry point.
- Using JSX to write HTML-like syntax inside JavaScript.

### 2. **State Management with `useState`**
- How to store data (quotes) in a componentâ€™s state.
- Updating the UI dynamically when the state changes.

### 3. **Fetching Data from an API**
- Using the `fetch()` method to get data from an external API.
- Understanding asynchronous JavaScript (`async/await`).
- Handling API responses and converting them into usable JSON data.

### 4. **Event Handling**
- Attaching `onClick` events to buttons.
- Triggering a function when the button is clicked to fetch a new quote.

### 5. **Styling in React**
- Writing a dedicated CSS file and importing it into the React project.
- Using Flexbox to center content.
- Creating a card-style container for clean UI.
- Styling buttons with hover effects and transitions.

### 6. **Project Structuring**
- Keeping code organized by separating logic (`App.js`) and styling (`App.css`).
- Understanding the importance of clear, readable code.
